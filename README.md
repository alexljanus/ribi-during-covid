### README File for Project Rotary During Covid-19

#### Directory: alexljanus/ribi-during-covid/SQLite-database-and-other-data-files

This directory contains a Jupyter notebook that creates the ribi-during-covid SQLite database as well as other data files from this database--namely, pickled data frames for use in Python, .csv files, and .sav files for use in SPSS. These other data file formats have also been put here so that the user does not need to create them separately.
