This involved 200 hours of work, research in, writing, selecting photographs ,helping the person doing the layout for printing and proof-reading.

Later I became unhappy with the way the President dominated and appeared not to listen to the views of others.  Since the beginning of the new Rotary year (1st July), \ I have been very happy with the way the new President runs the meetings.  A real positive has been that it has been possible to participate in District events without having to travel and the District Governor and his team have been very thoughtful in the way they run meetings, for instance in the way they use Chat to manage questions - just like the School of Mathematics at your university in the way they run ERGO seminars.",1,0,1,Both,,Contribution of time,Increased,,In part,56.4338073730468,-3.164794921875

The age profile also made it somewhat difficult to entice some members to try out video conference facilities eg. Zoom for both social and business get togethers.    ,I organised the establishment of an emergency fund which members contributed to during lockdown. The funds donated were used to purchase food vouchers from local high street shops eg. butchers and fruit/veg. The vouchers were then given to Nairn Citizens Advice Bureau for distribution to those most vulnerable. This initiative is likely to continue for the foreseeable future as an increasing number of people are made redundant and are unable to find alternative employment particularly in the tourism and related industries.   ,I organised a weekly quiz night for members and their partners via Zoom which was well attended particularly by those who were under isolation restrictions as for some it was there only engagement with others for several days.  ,"Yes, negatively impacted","Yes, negatively impacted","Yes, negatively impacted","Yes, mixed impact",COVID-19 has led to the cancellation of a number of fundraising events which has impacted negatively on the financial position of the club which in turn has significantly reduced our ability to make donations to other worthy causes and projects.  Several of our members are engaged in delivering services within the community eg. local community transport service which has not been able to operate throughout the lockdown period. While we have retained almost full membership for the new Rotary year it is clear that unless we can recruit new younger members then Rotary Nairn will no longer exist. It is probably the biggest challenge we face into the future.,Despite the various difficulties that members faced individually during COVID-19 the response to our Emergency Appeal to help others was heart warming. Also fellowship amongst members has been strengthened despite the lack of face to face meetings as the majority embraced Zoom and were appreciative of the ongoing communication via email of bi-weekly newsletters and other information.  ,1,0,0,Both,,,Increased,,In part,57.610107421875,-3.61759948730468

This is a shame as we dont want them to feel side-lined. We have tried very hard to make sure every member has the opportunity to join in Zoom meetings (providing old tablets and laptops where necessary - or just help with the technology) so that they can feel involved as much as possible.

This was good for maintaining personal friendships but not the same as interacting with a group.  As  general restrictions eased many of our members were shielding due to age or medical conditions so we began to use Zoom meetings to get together as a club. This has been quite successfull for many  of us but a couple of our older members have retired from the club as they found it difficult to or did not wish to use Zoom  and email and they missed the fellowship of actual meetings although we continued to talk with them by phone. We have now begun to meet in small socially distanced groups in cafes and gardens as well as using Zoom.,The club recieved an appeal for help from a local foodbank.  We arranged for a greengrocery wholesale firm to supply fresh fruit to the foodbank and donated money to cover 12 weeks of this supply. Several members including me began to volunteer at the depot packing foodparcels and making deliveries to clients homes. The club held the annual Plant Sale virtually rather than in the usual venue and donated all of the proceeds to the foodbank to allow it to purchase further supplies and arranged for some large donations of goods such as tinned tomatoes to be delivered to them. We have joined in with the Rotary4foodbanks initiative to provide low cost goods to foodbanks.,"Members of the club together with  a church run a monthly Memory Cafe for older people, particularly those with dementia, and their families/carers. Since Covid 19 we have tried to keep in touch with regular attendees by phone to assist with isolation and in some cases to collect and deliver prescriptions, shopping etc. I phone 2 of the cafe users and am beginning to see some of them out in the community occasionally.  I collected and delivered prescriptions and medication for fellow members during the lockdown period. Our club, via trustees and other Rotarians, runs Aquabox a registered charity assembling water filters, packing and shipping them free of charge to disaster areas around the world. Although many of the volunteer activities at the depot, trustees have managed to arrange shipments to Yemen and other places recently.  I have been involved in assisting with a move from one site of operations to an adjacent more suitable depot which has been brought forward to be carried out while other activities have not been possible. I will be continuing as a volunteer assembling filter pumps once distancing measures have been established at the new site.  I supported a club donation to a local school to purchase PPE for the return to school this September, also a donation to a school in India (assisted as a long term project by another Rotary club) where staff and children are facing starvation due to the impact of Covid 19.  I am helping to coordinate a virtual balloon race  starting on 31st October as a new type of fundrasier for our club, to raise money for our own causes and for a local charity, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust.
